## Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)

The Transport Layer is responsible for **end-to-end communication between two devices**. Its main goal is to ensure that data sent from one application on a device reaches the correct application on another device **accurately, completely, and in the correct order**.

This layer does **not care about the physical path, cables, or routing decisions**. Those are handled by lower layers. The Transport Layer only focuses on the **data itself** and its reliable delivery between applications.

## Key Responsibilities of the Transport Layer

### 1. End-to-End Communication

The Transport Layer provides communication **from application to application**, not just device to device. It ensures that data generated by a specific application on the sender side is delivered to the correct application on the receiver side.

This is achieved using **port numbers**, which identify applications uniquely.

---

### 2. Segmentation

Applications often generate large amounts of data. Sending this data as a single unit is inefficient.

**Segmentation** is the process of dividing a large message into smaller units called *segments*.

Each segment contains:

* **Sequence number** – to maintain correct order
* **Port number** – to identify the source and destination application

At the receiver side, the Transport Layer:

* Reassembles the segments
* Ensures data is delivered in the correct sequence

---

### 3. Flow Control

Flow control ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver.

Example:

* Server sending data at high speed
* Mobile device receiving data at lower speed

If data is sent faster than the receiver can process, data loss may occur. The Transport Layer controls the transmission rate so the receiver can handle the incoming data properly.

---

### 4. Error Control

During transmission, data may face errors. The Transport Layer detects and handles these errors.

#### Types of Errors:

**a) Missing Data**

* Some segments are lost during transmission
* Example: Segment 2 is missing while Segment 1 and Segment 3 arrive

**b) Modified Data**

* Data is altered or segments arrive in the wrong order
* Example: Segment 3 arrives before Segment 1

The Transport Layer:

* Detects errors
* Requests retransmission if needed
* Ensures data integrity and correct sequencing

---

### 5. Connection Control

The Transport Layer manages how connections are established, maintained, and terminated.

There are two main protocols:

#### a) TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* Connection-oriented protocol
* Establishes a connection before data transfer (handshake)
* Guarantees data delivery
* Provides error detection and correction
* Ensures ordered delivery
* Closes connection after transmission

Used in applications like:

* Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Email
* File transfer

#### b) UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* Connectionless protocol
* No connection setup
* No guarantee of delivery
* Faster but unreliable
* No retransmission or ordering

Used in applications like:

* Video streaming
* Online gaming
* Voice calls

## Summary

The Transport Layer ensures reliable, ordered, and application-specific data delivery between two devices. It uses segmentation, flow control, error control, and connection control to achieve accurate end-to-end communication. Its focus is not on how data travels, but on **whether it arrives correctly and reaches the right application**.
