🌐 OSI Model Overview

OSI – Open Systems Interconnection

Think of the OSI Model as a 7-step journey that data follows when it moves from your device to another device over a network.

It doesn’t do networking by itself — it’s more like a guidebook that helps us understand how communication happens.

📚 OSI Model Layers (Top to Bottom)

Application

Presentation

Session

Transport

Network

Data Link

🏗️ OSI Layers – Grouped for Easy Understanding
🔹 Top 3 Layers → Software Layers

These layers are close to the user and applications.
They mainly deal with software, data formatting, and communication control.

1️⃣ Application Layer

User interacts here

Browsers, email, apps

2️⃣ Presentation Layer

Data format

Encryption

Compression

3️⃣ Session Layer

Starts, manages, and ends communication sessions

👉 Called Software Layers because they work mostly in software and OS level.

🔸 Middle Layer → Heart of the OSI Model
4️⃣ Transport Layer ❤️

Controls end-to-end communication

Data segmentation and reassembly

Error control and flow control

Protocols: TCP, UDP

👉 Called the heart of OSI because it connects the software side and hardware side and ensures reliable delivery.

🔹 Bottom 3 Layers → Hardware Layers

These layers are close to physical devices and network media.

5️⃣ Network Layer

Logical addressing (IP)

Routing data across networks

6️⃣ Data Link Layer

MAC addresses

Error detection

Frame delivery

7️⃣ Physical Layer

Cables

Signals

Bits (0s and 1s)

👉 Called Hardware Layers because they involve NICs, switches, routers, cables, and signals.
