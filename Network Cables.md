# 🌟 Network Cables – UTP, STP, Fiber Optic

## 1️⃣ UTP – Unshielded Twisted Pair

### ✅ What it is
- Most common network cable  
- Twisted pairs of copper wires inside  
- **No extra shielding** (unprotected from interference)  

### 🔹 Features
- Cheap and easy to install  
- Speed depends on CAT type (Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a)  
- Works for short distances (~100 meters)  

### 💡 Cybersecurity View
- Easy to **tap or intercept data physically**  
- Less protection against interference  

---

## 2️⃣ STP – Shielded Twisted Pair

### ✅ What it is
- Similar to UTP but with **shielding** (foil or braided metal)  
- Protects against **electromagnetic interference (EMI)**  

### 🔹 Features
- More expensive than UTP  
- Used in industrial or noisy environments  
- Can travel slightly longer distances without interference  

### 💡 Cybersecurity View
- Harder to **physically tap or sniff data**  
- Provides better **signal integrity and security**

---

## 3️⃣ Fiber Optic Cable

### ✅ What it is
- Uses **light pulses** instead of electricity to transmit data  
- Very thin **glass core** inside  

### 🔹 Features
- Extremely fast data transfer  
- Works over **very long distances** (tens to hundreds of km)  
- Immune to electromagnetic interference  

### 💡 Cybersecurity View
- Very **hard to tap** without detection  
- Used in **banks, data centers, ISPs, government networks**  
- High security for critical data

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Cable Type | Signal              | Speed        | Distance           | Protection       | Cybersecurity Notes         |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| UTP       | Electrical         | Medium      | Short (~100 m)   | None           | Easy to tap physically     |
| STP       | Electrical + Shield| Medium-High | Medium           | Shielded       | Harder to tap              |
| Fiber     | Light              | Very High   | Very Long (10s-100s km) | Very High   | Very hard to tap, secure  |

##  Quick Memory Trick
- **UTP →** Normal LAN cable, unprotected  
- **STP →** UTP + shield (protected)  
- **Fiber →** Light cable, ultra-fast & secure
